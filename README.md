# Simons-Game
Simon's Game is an engaging and interactive project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is a digital rendition of the classic memory game where players must remember and replicate sequences of colors and sounds.
## Key Features:
* User Interface: The game interface consists of four colored buttons that light up in sequence. The use of CSS ensures a visually appealing design with responsive layouts.
* Game Logic: Implemented using JavaScript, the game generates random sequences that players must follow. As the game progresses, sequences become longer and more challenging.
* DOM Manipulation: The project leverages JavaScript to dynamically update the game state, highlight buttons, and provide feedback to the player. This involves extensive use of querySelector to interact with HTML elements.
* Learning jQuery: Although primarily written in vanilla JavaScript, the project helped deepen understanding of jQuery. This included manipulating the DOM more efficiently and handling events in a more streamlined way.
* Audio Integration: Sounds are triggered using JavaScript to enhance the gaming experience, providing auditory cues that accompany the visual sequence.
